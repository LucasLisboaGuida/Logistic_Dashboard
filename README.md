Logistics Dashboard – Fleet and Delivery Performance

This project presents a business intelligence dashboard developed in Power BI to monitor logistics operations performance. It aims to provide decision-making insights through data visualization related to delivery volume, vehicle efficiency, operational costs, and return reasons.

Created as part of my portfolio to demonstrate data analysis, visualization design, and storytelling for logistics-focused dashboards.

- Overview of deliveries by region, month, and vehicle type
- KPI cards (total orders, freight value, distance traveled, cost)
- Return rate and reasons breakdown
- Filters by period, region, vehicle type
- Interactive navigation menu for user-friendly experience

Tools and Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX for calculated metrics
- Data cleaning and modeling from Excel files

Dataset
The dataset simulates a logistics company’s delivery records, fleet data, cost reports, and return occurrences. All data is anonymized and fictional, created for educational and portfolio purposes.
